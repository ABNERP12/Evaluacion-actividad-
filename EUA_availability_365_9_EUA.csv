San Francisco has been my home now for 30 years and I love my condo, my neighborhood and my city!  

I've lived in many places abroad and in the US but by far, San Francisco is my favorite place in the whole wide world.   

Having said that, I would like to visit the whole wide world!!  

I love to travel and enjoy meeting new and interesting people.  I am passionate about music and enjoy almost anything to do with the Arts.  On a cold rainy day I love a good book or movie.  I especially appreciate good company and good conversation but I also like my privacy and alone time. I am a foodie and am always looking for good restaurants or eateries and am blessed that San Francisco has many of these. 

I totally subscribe to living a sustainable life-style and appreciate if you join me in creating a greener planet.  California now suffers from frequent droughts so we are very conscientious here about not wasting water. I encourage my guests to conserve both water and energy, even during wet years. 

Suffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.

I am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.  All my bedding have hypo-allergenic encasings.   As a result I cannot accept guests with pets, even if theyâ€™re a service animal or emotional support pets.  

I would appreciate confirmed guests informing me in advance of their arrival and departure schedules so I can schedule the cleaners accordingly .   

My condo is on the second floor so my address is not going to be easily visible from the street level so please the directions to my place.  The entrance to my condo complex has a white wrought iron gate with Ripley Condominiums in the front.  You will need a key to enter the gate and my condo unit so communication and coordination is critical .   

Please do not bother neighbors when you arrive or during your stay.  

Thank You and looking forward to making your acquaintance.

Cecilia aka Gina

Not to mention our neighborhood is the warmest, flattest, and fog free part of San Francisco.

Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, Europe, Central America, and of course all over North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. 

As your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from scuba diving, biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things teens, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco. My motto is from the great Mahatma Ghandi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" Our style of hosting reflects the needs of our guests. When possible, we like to meet our guests. However we understand that many of them are busy on a tight schedule or not interested to meet us so we respect that. We want to make sure every guest is comfortable and part of that is respecting boundaries and their personal space. 

We look forward to hosting you soon! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We're just a click away.

I truly love San Francisco and Russian Hill in particular. I manage my own art business and love collecting and restoring antiques. I also love traveling, wine tasting, hiking, visiting museums and galleries, cooking, and checking out new San Francisco restaurants and coffee shops.

I am passionate about respecting and maintaining San Franciscoâ€™s old world charm. I personally restored this property, keeping as much of the original details that I could while creating a comfortable atmosphere with modern conveniences. I want guests to have an authentic San Francisco experience, and hope the space I have created will make you feel at home. 

Because I have lived here for so long, I can provide guests with tips on sites and local restaurants that are off of the beaten path. I can also recommend neighborhood walks that expose guests to the historic and cultural charm that San Francisco has to offer. Since I often go to Napa and Sonoma, I have many recommendations of wineries that you may want to visit. 

I am proud of my adopted city and my home and want to share them with you. I hope that you can experience all the wonders of San Francisco that I am so lucky to enjoy everyday.

I also love gardening, culture, fashion, camping, history and living in SF.
I like Airbnb because I can taste the travel energy without the actual travel, I have met very interesting & wonderful people & I love showing guests the best of SF life.   The best compliment I can receive is when my guests want to return, it makes me happy.  

For 23 years, I owned one of the last Latin cultural stores in the community, it was a landmark legacy business which gave me a very intimate & spiritual connection to the Mission- hence why I  was  picked to film an Airbnb success story commercial you may have seen on u-tube called 
""Airbnb Nancy"" - what a blast!
