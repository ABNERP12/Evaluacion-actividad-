I love what San Francisco city and the Bay Area has to offer. I feel very lucky and privileged to live in a beautiful and safe area of San Francisco called Pacific Heights. 

I am an avid mountaineer/climber and I travel usually once a year, for a month - long expedition trip. That is usually when I open the calendar in AirBnB for my apartment, as well as (separately) for my garage. 

I would like to rent my beautiful home to someone reliable for all that time when I am gone. 

The things I can't live without are my family, friends, mountains, my amazing home, nature, meditation and any kind of physical activity daily. 

My favorite travel destinations - to many to mention. I feel amazing in high altitude mountains. 

I climbed all the highest mountains in the world called Seven Summits (including Mt.Everest), as well as skied to the South Pole.  Beside that, all my travels and expeditions left me with amazing memories. 

My favorite books - too many to list here as I  read a lot, but I love the most  ""Master and Margarita"" by Michail Bulhakov. There are many books in my home, so if you have time feel free to read something new. I switched now to ebooks or audiobooks, as it doesn't take any physical space. 

My favorite food is prepared with local and organic ingredients - check out many restaurants on Fillmore street - you will have so many to choose from, even after Pandemic years. I love sushi and the best sushi in the city is a walking distance from my home - check out Tataki restaurant (on California street/Divisadero street) - amazing and fresh! 
I also would encourage you to check â€œState Bird Provisionsâ€, but you would need a reservation. Itâ€™s a 7 -10 minutes walking distance from my home. Located on Fillmore street. 

I travel a lot for business - Marriott hotels, but for fun - I prefer staying in a tent or in a cool Airbnb place in different cities all over the world. 

My motto in life is to live largely, â€œon the edge of my comfort zone"", hence climbing or polar expeditions, and now posting my home at Airbnb website. 

Throughout the process of renting my home I learn that my HOAâ€™s CC&Rs (Homeowners Rules) do not allow for any short term rentals and I can only rent it for a month or longer. 

My modern apartment is located on the top floor of the beautiful Victorian (freshly painted) building (originally from 1896). I have the best view of Japan Town and Twin Towers as well as complete privacy in my home. 

I love green plants and I have many in my home and at the balcony. Iâ€™ll be very grateful if you could please water it once a week ( just a little bit :) to keep it lush and green. 

So far, I had wonderful guests from all over the world for the last ten years. I am super grateful for all people I met through AirBnB. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions before you send a reservation. 

I look forward to meeting you in person and to host you in my home.

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; Iâ€™m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersâ€™ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.
