We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

My priority is to offer nice, clean, safe and well located place; at a  affordable rate.

I lived working in the service/tourism business for 5 years in Playa del Carmen Mexico, a tourism industry focused city in the Mexican Caribbean, where I learnt the tourism business and met many travelers like myself and you.
From my experience working in the tourism industry and as a traveler as well I know first hand how helpful a good tip can be in regards to where to go, places of interest, where to eat, how to get around and the importance of knowing where to go in case of a health emergency and how to stay safe. 

I currently live in Mexico City, work has brought me back to the city where I am from.
As a local and having been around for nearly 40 years I know the city extremely well. If you need any tips on where to eat, where to go, how to get around, and maybe more important WHERE NOT TO, WHEN NOT TO, and HOW NOT TO make sure to ask. I want my guests to have a great time in my place, my city and my country.

Traveling and meeting new people is my passion. I have been to many places (not enough yet) and met loads of amazing people along the way. Been in the tourism/service business for nearly 15 years, in direct contact with foreigners and expats for nearly 25, so I can communicate and advise about pretty much anything with particular great expertise. I will be a very helpful and safe host during your stay.
Unless Iâm out of town or in exceptional circumstances, very few times I donât meet my guests.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

My first experience with Airbnb was in August 2014, as a guest, traveling to Chicago USA.
The experience was very good, so in September 2014 decided to join as a host, offering a couple of options and prices to stay in Mexico City.

I like that the guests enjoy their stay and their space, in total privacy.
My priority is to offer nice, clean, safe and well located place; at a  affordable rate.

I have always lived in Mexico City, I know it very well. It will be a pleasure to guide you and help you with any questions, suggestions that you require, or need that you have.

Llevo mÃ¡s de 6 aÃ±os recibiendo huÃ©spedes de todo el mundo y siendo huÃ©sped de la plataforma, incluso dentro de misma ciudad, asÃ­ que te garantizo que yo sÃ© perfectamente que es lo que mÃ¡s se necesita durante una estancia larga o corta, la calidez es clave y tener todo a la mano, le da magia al asunto, confÃ­a en mi y dÃ©jame consentirte como tu te mereces en tu estancia.

I have a degree in Tourism, my passion is to travel and life has given me the opportunity to go around the world getting to know many countries and cultures.
I have worked for the tourism industry for over ten years, even aboard Disney Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises and Princess Cruises.
I love Mexico City because it has everything for a magnificent stay.
My favorite places are the Chapultepec Forest and Castle, the Anthropology Museum, the Centro HIstorico (central downtown and the Palace of Fine Arts.
On the outskirts is the ruins of the City of Teotihuacan and the magic town of Xochimilco.
I enjoy sharing with positive and enterprising people.
I hope to see you soonâ¦

Walking down the wide, colorful avenues gives you the time and space to enjoy the architecture, discover hidden boutiques, and take in the energy from this incredible neighborhood.Â <br />For more efficient transportation, utilize the bike lanes along Avenida de los Insurgentes. For bicycle rental options, there are numerous EcoBici stations scattered throughout Roma. In order to use EcoBici, you must have a card, so they arenât ideal for tourists with a limited travel window.

*If you want to know more about the house I was interviewed for a interior design magazine to talk about my home  the title of the publication is ""Blending Modern with Vintage in This Stunning Mexico City  Home"" you can find it on the internet. Below the full article:

BLENDING MODERN WITH VINTAGE IN THIS STUNNING MEXICO CITY HOME

Located in Mexico cityâs stylish San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood, Santiago Vertiz first moved into his 2006-built home ten years ago.

At the time, Santiago didnât own furniture and slept on a mattress in the empty space â an image in stark contrast to the harmonious blend of modern vs vintage we now see. Vertiz spent years searching for pieces that inspire him, whilst highlighting his Mexican culture.
Fascinated by pre-Columbian cultures and inspired by childhood memories of his grandparentsâ houses, many antique pieces fill the house, as well as colourful original modern art, handicrafts and textiles from Mexico and Guatemala.

Nature plays an important role throughout the home, and an entire wall of glass doors opens to the patio, seamlessly blending the indoors with the outdoors. Says Vertiz, âPlants play a very important role in life and in my home. They are the protagonists that bring life, change, and color.â
Santiagoâs mission has been to recover, collect, restore, and redesign furniture and other pieces that inspire him, while working with the houseâs unique architectural features to amplify its height and to bring life to the space.

What attracted you to your home?
Mexico City can be very hectic, you can easily spend half of your life in traffic. I felt it was a luxury to be able to walk to places without using a car.
I knew I wanted to live in a central location, close to the classic neighborhoods â Condesa, Roma and Polanco are some of the most well-known, but also in high demand. A friend introduced me to San Miguel Chapultepec, which is a residential neighborhood making it quiet, safe and strategically located. Itâs across the street from Bosque de Chapultepec and home to many artists and galleries.
Secondly, I was excited by the architectural project. The architectâs goal was to make a town house project resembling a loft, instead of a classical building. There are actually ten identical houses with spacious, double-height ceilings overlooking a private terrace.
When I discovered the space, it had already been built, but I was able to modify the size of the terrace space, and since the view is very important to me, we made a front wall to allow plants to grow in.

Did you have a vision for your home?
I wanted my house to be a place I felt comfortable in, that I could enjoy and feel relaxed. I didnât want to have a party house â as I said to an old roommate, âMy house is my templeâ.
I had to improvise and play around a lot with the location of certain pieces, so there was trial and error involved. I would stay up at night thinking of new things I could do to the house â it was a lot of fun!

How did your fascination with pre-Columbian cultures influence the design of your home?
My maternal grandparents came from Merida, Yucatan and had deep knowledge of Mayan cultures. My grandfather would tell us tales of his many visits into the jungle and his friendship with archeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier. Not only was he present in the discovery of the Pakal tomb, but he actually helped by providing some of the machinery needed to uncover the tomb. My oldest uncle, a boy at the time, took the first pictures ever of the tomb. Iâve inherited a deep admiration and respect for the Mayas and their communities.
One spring break my parents took us on a road trip, passing through Veracruz into Chiapas, and visiting different ruins along the way. We camped out in the middle of the jungle, next to the Usumacinta river on the border of Mexico and Guatemala. We walked some distance to the ruins of Yaxichilan, and in another location camped with a Lacandon Community, reliving the experience that my grandfather once had.
When I visit a region, anywhere in the world, I value the nativesâ culture and appreciate the hard work and beauty that goes into their handcrafts.

I lived working in the service/tourism business for 5 years in Playa del Carmen Mexico, a tourism industry focused city in the Mexican Caribbean, where I learnt the tourism business and met many travelers like myself and you.
From my experience working in the tourism industry and as a traveler as well I know first hand how helpful a good tip can be in regards to where to go, places of interest, where to eat, how to get around and the importance of knowing where to go in case of a health emergency and how to stay safe. 

I currently live in Mexico City, work has brought me back to the city where I am from.
As a local and having been around for nearly 40 years I know the city extremely well. If you need any tips on where to eat, where to go, how to get around, and maybe more important WHERE NOT TO, WHEN NOT TO, and HOW NOT TO make sure to ask. I want my guests to have a great time in my place, my city and my country.

Traveling and meeting new people is my passion. I have been to many places (not enough yet) and met loads of amazing people along the way. Been in the tourism/service business for nearly 15 years, in direct contact with foreigners and expats for nearly 25, so I can communicate and advise about pretty much anything with particular great expertise. I will be a very helpful and safe host during your stay.
Unless Iâm out of town or in exceptional circumstances, very few times I donât meet my guests.

Soy una viajera, como tÃºâ¦ y para mi es muy importante encontrar lugares en los que me sienta bienvenida e inspirada para realizar todas esas actividades Ãºnicas que cada ciudad en el mundo tiene para ofrecer. Es por eso que decidÃ­ iniciar con la experiencia de ser hospedadora, para poder ser parte de este viaje mÃ¡gico que solo la Ciudad de MÃ©xico tiene para recibirte. 
 
Los lugares que tengo disponibles para ti, estÃ¡n ubicados en las zonas mÃ¡s bellas y seguras de esta ciudad, donde puedes encontrar desde los mejores restaurantes y antros, hasta los mÃ¡s extraÃ±os museos y galerÃ­as. Todos esperando a ser descubiertos por ti. Los departamemtos son acogedores, limpios y organizados, gracias a todo el equipo que existe junto a mi. Con quienes podrÃ¡s contar para cualquier duda que tengas durante tu estancia.
 
AdemÃ¡s de mi gusto por ser hospedadora, tambiÃ©n soy dentista en Hola Diente y en ambos casos me gusta ayudar a las personas que visitan esta ciudad. Eso me ha llevado a unir ambas vocaciones y encontrar el TURISMO DENTAL. AsÃ­ que si tienes una emergencia dental o incluso si quieres una limpieza antes de tu prÃ³xima aventura, en Hola Diente estaremos encantados de ayudar.

Espero que puedas disfrutar de tu estancia en Ciudad de MÃ©xico, junto con los lugares de  hospedaje que tengo para ti. Bienvenidx.

saludos


I'm Carlos, relaxed and fun, I like to talk, I like to travel, and I try to exercise daily ... I like animals and as far as I can, I try to take care of the environment.

I am a TV director so I travel a lot and my schedules when I have a project are very long followed by periods without doing anything ... ""my house is your house"" and I have always been like this, I like to receive people, I like to make friends.

I am divorced and I have two children who do not live with me, the one that lives with me is my dog BullDog Mikaela, but now she is out of MÃ©xico visiting with the grandparents in Tijuana, I live between CDMX, Los Angeles, and Tijuana, normally she travels with me to everywhere.

I love photography, painting, and art in general, I think that's why I've always been dedicated to acting and directing.

I hope your stay at home is pleasant and enjoy this city that welcomed me with open arms 30 years ago and love it as I do in spite of all its problems.
