We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

I love travelling, meeting new people, sharing ideas, taste new food, shooting photographies, walking new ways and enjoy life. I really love getting involved into other cultures. I will suggest you the best places in town :) 

Me as a traveller: 
I am always planning a new trip. Since I started to travel by myself I never have been in a hotel. I prefer to get along with local people, see how they use to live. I always prefer to visit different places an not the usuals or touristic spaces of the cities. When I am in a new city I use to get out and start walking without direction and discover places by myself. I keep the maps in my bag and doesn't matter if I get lost, I like to recognize all the places around,  the streets,  the details, see everything that is posible, and find by myself all the different ways to get back home...  I have a lot of good memories in all the places I have visisted. I find the beauty of each city in the people that I met and in all the experiences that I have there, those are the first things that come to my mind when I think in some place, the rest comes apart. 
I don't want to be a tourist, I just want to make mine every place I visit. 

Favorite places: Chacahua, Oaxaca. Mexico, City, Chiapas, Mexico. New York, Paris, Ghent, Belgium. Sweeden, Tokyo, Berlin! 

Me as a guest: 
I am always trying to live new experiences.  I had experiencies with another ways to lodging and all them have been amazing. I just read about this project ""Airbnb"" and I found it great and denfinetily I knew that I had to try it. 
I'm very independent, most of the time I am out of the house. When there is time I like to get along with my hosts but also I am so respectful with your space, I'm very very very clean and orderly. I don't smoke. We can talk about music, movies, trips, books... I love sharing music. 
I am food lover, I receive all kind of suggestions!

Years ago when creating an profile on AIRBNB, it was required to add a personal photo and to write a brief description (BIO) or ourselves (as HOST and/or GUEST). / Now this seems to have changed and some individuals that don't have it, forget that we're opening our homes and want to know a bit of who's coming.

Some don't provide an official ID, are new at AIRBNB  or haven't been active in a while, therefore they don't have a REVIEW.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

Travelling one of many passions.
My house is a temple,  love to share it with guests and treat them as they deserve. The energy one feels stepping inside the house is one of ""nice to be home""
Guess I expect to feel the same, when I travel.  

As a guest I will respect every corner of the house I get in, as I shall expect the guests that stay at my house do the same -when staying at my place-.

Love to:
Eat, enchanting places, art, 
to read and a movie freak.

My favorite destinations are the cities that have tons to tell. Europe and Eastern Europe are my favorite destinations. Asia, blows my mind. When I travel to Asia, I would probably stay in one of the best venues. History is part of my life so as long as the destination has historical links, it will probably fit in this category.
