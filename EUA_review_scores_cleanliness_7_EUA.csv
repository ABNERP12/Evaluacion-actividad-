San Francisco has been my home now for 30 years and I love my condo, my neighborhood and my city!  

I've lived in many places abroad and in the US but by far, San Francisco is my favorite place in the whole wide world.   

Having said that, I would like to visit the whole wide world!!  

I love to travel and enjoy meeting new and interesting people.  I am passionate about music and enjoy almost anything to do with the Arts.  On a cold rainy day I love a good book or movie.  I especially appreciate good company and good conversation but I also like my privacy and alone time. I am a foodie and am always looking for good restaurants or eateries and am blessed that San Francisco has many of these. 

I totally subscribe to living a sustainable life-style and appreciate if you join me in creating a greener planet.  California now suffers from frequent droughts so we are very conscientious here about not wasting water. I encourage my guests to conserve both water and energy, even during wet years. 

Suffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.

I am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.  All my bedding have hypo-allergenic encasings.   As a result I cannot accept guests with pets, even if theyâ€™re a service animal or emotional support pets.  

I would appreciate confirmed guests informing me in advance of their arrival and departure schedules so I can schedule the cleaners accordingly .   

My condo is on the second floor so my address is not going to be easily visible from the street level so please the directions to my place.  The entrance to my condo complex has a white wrought iron gate with Ripley Condominiums in the front.  You will need a key to enter the gate and my condo unit so communication and coordination is critical .   

Please do not bother neighbors when you arrive or during your stay.  

Thank You and looking forward to making your acquaintance.

Cecilia aka Gina

I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  

My homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa FÃ© de San Francisco de AsÃ­s (â€œThe Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisiâ€).

My San Francisco home is on Potrero Hill.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.

My other homes are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., Gorgeous on Garcia and Casa Kateri, in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly ""Santa Fe Style"" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.  Casa Laguna is in the Quail Run resort community in Santa Fe, just a few miles from town.  There you can access the golf course, tennis/pickle ball courts, swimming pool, and wonderful trail system.

As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:

1) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly and feel free to ask questions. Hosts with popular listings appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. 

2) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.

3)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:

â€¢ in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc) 
â€¢ include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"") 
â€¢ let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)

4) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!

Hope this is helpful.

We invite you to stay with us in our 1896 Edwardian home in the middle of the Mission District, San Francisco's oldest and arguably most vibrant neighborhood filled with a diverse range of some of the City's best restaurants, bars, parks, shops, and more. Not to mention our neighborhood is the warmest, flattest, and fog free part of San Francisco. 

We're 15 minutes from SFO by taxi, a block and a half from the 24th Bart Station and close to many bus and MUNI (subway) lines. Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, Europe, Central America, and of course all over North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. 

As your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from scuba diving, biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things teens, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco. My motto is from the great Mahatma Ghandi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" Our style of hosting reflects the needs of our guests. When possible, we like to meet our guests. However we understand that many of them are busy on a tight schedule or not interested to meet us so we respect that. We want to make sure every guest is comfortable and part of that is respecting boundaries and their personal space. 

We look forward to hosting you soon! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We're just a click away.

I love what San Francisco city and the Bay Area has to offer. I feel very lucky and privileged to live in a beautiful and safe area of San Francisco called Pacific Heights. 

I am an avid mountaineer/climber and I travel usually once a year, for a month - long expedition trip. That is usually when I open the calendar in AirBnB for my apartment, as well as (separately) for my garage. 

I would like to rent my beautiful home to someone reliable for all that time when I am gone. 

The things I can't live without are my family, friends, mountains, my amazing home, nature, meditation and any kind of physical activity daily. 

My favorite travel destinations - to many to mention. I feel amazing in high altitude mountains. 

I climbed all the highest mountains in the world called Seven Summits (including Mt.Everest), as well as skied to the South Pole.  Beside that, all my travels and expeditions left me with amazing memories. 

My favorite books - too many to list here as I  read a lot, but I love the most  ""Master and Margarita"" by Michail Bulhakov. There are many books in my home, so if you have time feel free to read something new. I switched now to ebooks or audiobooks, as it doesn't take any physical space. 

My favorite food is prepared with local and organic ingredients - check out many restaurants on Fillmore street - you will have so many to choose from, even after Pandemic years. I love sushi and the best sushi in the city is a walking distance from my home - check out Tataki restaurant (on California street/Divisadero street) - amazing and fresh! 
I also would encourage you to check â€œState Bird Provisionsâ€, but you would need a reservation. Itâ€™s a 7 -10 minutes walking distance from my home. Located on Fillmore street. 

I travel a lot for business - Marriott hotels, but for fun - I prefer staying in a tent or in a cool Airbnb place in different cities all over the world. 

My motto in life is to live largely, â€œon the edge of my comfort zone"", hence climbing or polar expeditions, and now posting my home at Airbnb website. 

Throughout the process of renting my home I learn that my HOAâ€™s CC&Rs (Homeowners Rules) do not allow for any short term rentals and I can only rent it for a month or longer. 

My modern apartment is located on the top floor of the beautiful Victorian (freshly painted) building (originally from 1896). I have the best view of Japan Town and Twin Towers as well as complete privacy in my home. 

I love green plants and I have many in my home and at the balcony. Iâ€™ll be very grateful if you could please water it once a week ( just a little bit :) to keep it lush and green. 

So far, I had wonderful guests from all over the world for the last ten years. I am super grateful for all people I met through AirBnB. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions before you send a reservation. 

I look forward to meeting you in person and to host you in my home.

I truly love San Francisco and Russian Hill in particular. I manage my own art business and love collecting and restoring antiques. I also love traveling, wine tasting, hiking, visiting museums and galleries, cooking, and checking out new San Francisco restaurants and coffee shops.

I am passionate about respecting and maintaining San Franciscoâ€™s old world charm. I personally restored this property, keeping as much of the original details that I could while creating a comfortable atmosphere with modern conveniences. I want guests to have an authentic San Francisco experience, and hope the space I have created will make you feel at home. 

Because I have lived here for so long, I can provide guests with tips on sites and local restaurants that are off of the beaten path. I can also recommend neighborhood walks that expose guests to the historic and cultural charm that San Francisco has to offer. Since I often go to Napa and Sonoma, I have many recommendations of wineries that you may want to visit. 

I am proud of my adopted city and my home and want to share them with you. I hope that you can experience all the wonders of San Francisco that I am so lucky to enjoy everyday.

I love learning and sharing about people, places, cultures and ideas. I'm passionate about consumer centric businesses, things and ideas that can help people in general in some form or the other. Academically I have crossed many disciplines from engineering to environmental science, energy management to finance and investment and worked in a few fields including venture capital and investment banking. I'm still learning not much through reading but more so through execution and conversation. 

Live more has been my way of living while having a less cluttered and more organized simple life style. If you ever happen to be my guest, you may enjoy a conversation over dinner or drinks.

I came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.
Because of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.  The chance to meet, talk, share a meal, converse with a group of people from different countries has to be good for our world.  I have a large map of the world in the living room and each guest puts a pin in the country from which they come.  It is thrilling to see the map fill and know that we have had good times with friends from all of those places!",within an hour,100%,98%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3022475/profile_pic/1343007587/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3022475/profile_pic/1343007587/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Alamo Square,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"San Francisco, California, United States",Western Addition,Private room in condo,Private room,2.0,"[""Cooking basics"", ""Shampoo"", ""TV"", ""Host greets you"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Washer"", ""Hot water"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Wifi"", ""Heating"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Iron"", ""First aid kit"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Essentials"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Breakfast"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Dryer""]",$140.00,t,06/03/2023,07/08/2015,13/02/2023,STR-0000427,t,808919,20200000000000.0,3022475.0,3.0,3.0,37.77819,-122.43721,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,360.0,3.0,3.0,1125.0,1125.0,3.0,1125.0,25.0,39.0,64.0,334.0,142.0,22.0,1.0,4.94,4.96,4.94,4.98,4.97,4.96,4.83,3.0,1.0,0.4,0.0,1.54

I grew up visiting my family in Norway during the summers and have duel citizenship with Norway. Thankfully my relatives enjoy visiting often. I hope to be able to visit them more in 2014. The more guests I have the easier it will be to make that a reality :) SO stay at my place!! 

I love to share my home with vacation rental guests. I have met so many kind and thoughtful people from all over the world. I grew up traveling frequently so now hosting brings the world to my door. YAY! It brings me great joy to have the opportunity to open my cherished home, and to share it with others. They can enjoy the space I have created and get to know San Francisco from the South of Market (SOMA) perspective. Right now SOMA really is the pulse of the city of San Francisco with all of the new restaurants, start ups, and wine bars. Not to mention SOMA is central to San Francisco highlights such as: Union Square, the Ball Park, the Cable Car ride, Westfield Mall and Market Street. It's even better to be one block from the Moscone Center, considering many of my guests are attending conferences during their stay! It is a pleasure to be able to offer everything at your fingers tips just steps away from my home and your home away from home.

I have had a photography business for over 14 years where I support women to be their best. It is an honor and privilege to have photographed over 2,500 exceptional and inspirational women. As well as incredibly fun and heartwarming.

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; Iâ€™m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersâ€™ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.

I love to travel, the last place I went was the Caribbean in Honduras (awesome) &  I have been day dreaming about my next destination-Colombia.  I also love to dance-all kinds but Samba is my religion!

For an authentically Mission experience there is a free Salsa lesson included in your stay- I can teach you in 15 mins -yes  it's that easy & just enough to fake the rest...
I also love gardening, culture, fashion, camping, history and living in SF.
I like Airbnb because I can taste the travel energy without the actual travel, I have met very interesting & wonderful people & I love showing guests the best of SF life.   The best compliment I can receive is when my guests want to return, it makes me happy.  

For 23 years, I owned one of the last Latin cultural stores in the community, it was a landmark legacy business which gave me a very intimate & spiritual connection to the Mission- hence why I  was  picked to film an Airbnb success story commercial you may have seen on u-tube called 
""Airbnb Nancy"" - what a blast!

Prior COVID I have served breakfast and dinner every day and I am sad that I canâ€™t do it anymore but the heart the love and the overall integrity is intact. 
If you know few things about Lebanese people, as I am one, family, values, generosity, insecurity, our priorities in our lives. That is what you will have in my home, a precious place that I have been living and growing with my children and hundreds of plants and trees for the last 29 yearsâ¤ï¸
We all live great lives, I am a designer/manufacturer working in China since the 90s so it makes it impossible  to continue easily when anyone with special needs or hotel mentality book our bedrooms. Please make sure to understand that I run an extremely tight ship and have eyes on every detail. We attend all matters immediately not only caring for all and everything but to make sure that issues are stoped before they begin.
Our home and neighborhood are extremely safe and as a designer with three amazingly gifted hard working adult children, we have designed this Jungle/Museum/Doll House and sanctuary. Clean air and environment, clean bathrooms and bedrooms are what awaits you, so welcome and enjoy these walls that express what I envision in my heart and soul as beautiful, all blending with art from different countries and periods in history, plants and colorsâ¤ï¸ 

We are super blessed and protected by a team of four fantastic Christian humans that work for us and help us keep it all magnificently well and clean for over sixteen years, that trust and security is PRICELESS and if it is the Lordâ€™s will, it will be yours too.
Our home faces the Pacific Ocean, about 50 blocks away and when it is not foggy, our sunsets are dream-like! That said, the fog crawls up from the ocean and literally sits on top of our homes and neighborhood most of the time, specially during the summer, thus, I cannot express enough the importance the travel accordingly.
There will probably be other guests like you during your stay so we ask to whisper between 8 PM and 10 in the morning and if youâ€™re going to be on the phone, you absolutely have to wear your headphones. Equally important is to notice that to enjoy good internet, as we all work online, we will ask that you choose ONE device for Wifi access. 

In order to keep control of all details, my children and I personally are constantly here to help, explain and be of any assistance to you all, so to be informed of any and all needs you might have: we WILL TRULY do our maximum to accommodate you so always let US KNOW what you need, please!

In as much as the prices in our listings are concerned, we are happy to offer a rate that is at least 60% off in comparison to our  neighbors because we are blessed enough so love to share!

I, the lucky mom and house owner, Lulu, speak eight languages, studying my ninth now and I am fortunate enough to travel around the world for business.

We look forward to sharing our lives with yâ€™all!

I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, ""Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death."" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now.

I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.
