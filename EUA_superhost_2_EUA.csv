I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  

My homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa FÃ© de San Francisco de AsÃ­s (â€œThe Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisiâ€).

My San Francisco home is on Potrero Hill.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.

My other homes are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., Gorgeous on Garcia and Casa Kateri, in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly ""Santa Fe Style"" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.  Casa Laguna is in the Quail Run resort community in Santa Fe, just a few miles from town.  There you can access the golf course, tennis/pickle ball courts, swimming pool, and wonderful trail system.

As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:

1) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly and feel free to ask questions. Hosts with popular listings appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. 

2) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.

3)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:

â€¢ in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc) 
â€¢ include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"") 
â€¢ let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)

4) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!

I love what San Francisco city and the Bay Area has to offer. I feel very lucky and privileged to live in a beautiful and safe area of San Francisco called Pacific Heights. 

I am an avid mountaineer/climber and I travel usually once a year, for a month - long expedition trip. That is usually when I open the calendar in AirBnB for my apartment, as well as (separately) for my garage. 

I would like to rent my beautiful home to someone reliable for all that time when I am gone. 

The things I can't live without are my family, friends, mountains, my amazing home, nature, meditation and any kind of physical activity daily. 

My favorite travel destinations - to many to mention. I feel amazing in high altitude mountains. 

I climbed all the highest mountains in the world called Seven Summits (including Mt.Everest), as well as skied to the South Pole.  Beside that, all my travels and expeditions left me with amazing memories. 

My favorite books - too many to list here as I  read a lot, but I love the most  ""Master and Margarita"" by Michail Bulhakov. There are many books in my home, so if you have time feel free to read something new. I switched now to ebooks or audiobooks, as it doesn't take any physical space. 

My favorite food is prepared with local and organic ingredients - check out many restaurants on Fillmore street - you will have so many to choose from, even after Pandemic years. I love sushi and the best sushi in the city is a walking distance from my home - check out Tataki restaurant (on California street/Divisadero street) - amazing and fresh! 
I also would encourage you to check â€œState Bird Provisionsâ€, but you would need a reservation. Itâ€™s a 7 -10 minutes walking distance from my home. Located on Fillmore street. 

I travel a lot for business - Marriott hotels, but for fun - I prefer staying in a tent or in a cool Airbnb place in different cities all over the world. 

My motto in life is to live largely, â€œon the edge of my comfort zone"", hence climbing or polar expeditions, and now posting my home at Airbnb website. 

Throughout the process of renting my home I learn that my HOAâ€™s CC&Rs (Homeowners Rules) do not allow for any short term rentals and I can only rent it for a month or longer. 

My modern apartment is located on the top floor of the beautiful Victorian (freshly painted) building (originally from 1896). I have the best view of Japan Town and Twin Towers as well as complete privacy in my home. 

I love green plants and I have many in my home and at the balcony. Iâ€™ll be very grateful if you could please water it once a week ( just a little bit :) to keep it lush and green. 

So far, I had wonderful guests from all over the world for the last ten years. I am super grateful for all people I met through AirBnB. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions before you send a reservation. 

I look forward to meeting you in person and to host you in my home.

I am passionate about respecting and maintaining San Franciscoâ€™s old world charm. I personally restored this property, keeping as much of the original details that I could while creating a comfortable atmosphere with modern conveniences. I want guests to have an authentic San Francisco experience, and hope the space I have created will make you feel at home. 

Because I have lived here for so long, I can provide guests with tips on sites and local restaurants that are off of the beaten path. I can also recommend neighborhood walks that expose guests to the historic and cultural charm that San Francisco has to offer. Since I often go to Napa and Sonoma, I have many recommendations of wineries that you may want to visit.

I came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.
Because of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; Iâ€™m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersâ€™ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends.

I also love gardening, culture, fashion, camping, history and living in SF.
I like Airbnb because I can taste the travel energy without the actual travel, I have met very interesting & wonderful people & I love showing guests the best of SF life.   The best compliment I can receive is when my guests want to return, it makes me happy.  

For 23 years, I owned one of the last Latin cultural stores in the community, it was a landmark legacy business which gave me a very intimate & spiritual connection to the Mission- hence why I  was  picked to film an Airbnb success story commercial you may have seen on u-tube called 
""Airbnb Nancy"" - what a blast!

I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, ""Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death."" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now.

Among the things I enjoy are movies, reading, ballet, progressive thought, and conversation - especially over good food and wine, both out and at my table.

I run a boutique consulting firm and sit on a few boards.  One of which is a international dog rescue and I have 2 wonderful dogs from Thailand (Singha & Jaidee.)  When I am in San Francisco, I can be found most days at yoga class, hiking, eating at one of San Francisco's amazing restaurants or jogging down by the water, which fortunately is one small block from my house.

Many were built before the big earthquake and are lovely Victorians.  Since then, many other interesting homes of later origin were built.  Divisadero, one of the earliest routes of the Spanish, is now an 'entertainment corridor' according to neighborhood planners.  It is certainly a destination place for young people and affords all of us plenty of grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, clubs, cleaners, et al....most of what you need to keep supplied and entertained.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/74633820/dc42fb2a_original.jpg,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3022475,Susan,22/07/2012,"San Francisco, CA","I have been a happy resident of San Francisco since 1994, living right here on McAllister St where I arrived after a former life-time married to a fine man, raising a family of three sons.
I came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.
Because of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.  The chance to meet, talk, share a meal, converse with a group of people from different countries has to be good for our world.  I have a large map of the world in the living room and each guest puts a pin in the country from which they come.  It is thrilling to see the map fill and know that we have had good times with friends from all of those places!",within an hour,100%,98%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3022475/profile_pic/1343007587/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3022475/profile_pic/1343007587/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Alamo Square,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"San Francisco, California, United States",Western Addition,Private room in rental unit,Private room,1.0,"[""Park view"", ""Oven"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""TV"", ""Dining table"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In unit"", ""Portable heater"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Coffee"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Garden view"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Hangers"", ""Body soap"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Microwave"", ""Hot water"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Wifi"", ""Central heating"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Freezer"", ""Shower gel"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Iron"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""First aid kit"", ""Stove"", ""Exercise equipment: free weights, yoga mat"", ""Books and reading material"", ""City skyline view"", ""Toaster"", ""Rice maker"", ""Free street parking"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Breakfast"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Conditioner"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",$100.00,t,06/03/2023,19/08/2013,26/02/2023,STR-0000427,t,1317908,20200000000000.0,3022475.0,3.0,3.0,37.77937,-122.43752,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,365.0,3.0,3.0,1125.0,1125.0,3.0,1125.0,14.0,29.0,51.0,310.0,175.0,4.5,1.0,4.9,4.88,4.93,4.95,4.97,4.95,4.82,3.0,1.0,0.4,0.0,1.51
