I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  

My homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa FÃ© de San Francisco de AsÃ­s (â€œThe Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisiâ€).

My San Francisco home is on Potrero Hill.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.

My other homes are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., Gorgeous on Garcia and Casa Kateri, in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly ""Santa Fe Style"" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.  Casa Laguna is in the Quail Run resort community in Santa Fe, just a few miles from town.  There you can access the golf course, tennis/pickle ball courts, swimming pool, and wonderful trail system.

As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:

1) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly and feel free to ask questions. Hosts with popular listings appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. 

2) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.

3)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:

â€¢ in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc) 
â€¢ include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"") 
â€¢ let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)

4) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!

We invite you to stay with us in our 1896 Edwardian home in the middle of the Mission District, San Francisco's oldest and arguably most vibrant neighborhood filled with a diverse range of some of the City's best restaurants, bars, parks, shops, and more. Not to mention our neighborhood is the warmest, flattest, and fog free part of San Francisco. 

We're 15 minutes from SFO by taxi, a block and a half from the 24th Bart Station and close to many bus and MUNI (subway) lines. Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, Europe, Central America, and of course all over North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. 

As your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from scuba diving, biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things teens, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco. My motto is from the great Mahatma Ghandi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" Our style of hosting reflects the needs of our guests. When possible, we like to meet our guests. However we understand that many of them are busy on a tight schedule or not interested to meet us so we respect that. We want to make sure every guest is comfortable and part of that is respecting boundaries and their personal space. 

We look forward to hosting you soon! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We're just a click away.

Our home is a short bus ride or cab ride away from fun neighborhoods like the Castro and the Mission so you can go out to dinner and drinks but then return to a quiet refuge after a day of activities. It's close to public transportation which makes reaching downtown simple and quick. There is a shopping center with a grocery store, a sandwich shop, a burger joint, a pizza place, a drug store, and a Starbucks right behind our house. And if you want to experience nature there are many trails at Mt. Davidson and in Glen Canyon Park, both right in our 'hood, that are perfect for that morning jog or urban hike!",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/6ee3465f-9d98-4f83-8835-983374537441.jpg,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3807182,Jennifer,08/10/2012,"San Francisco, CA","I am a proud resident of the vibrant City by the Bay!

My husband Chris and I are now in our 30's, and as much as we enjoy our time in San Francisco, we spend many weekends visiting friends & family, skiing in Tahoe and traveling to new places.  We bought a beautiful home last year and want to join AirBnB so others can take advantage of our great place while we're away.

More about us...during the week, Chris is a high school teacher and I work at a hedge fund.  Our weekends in town often involve dance music, watching sporting events, and  doing activities like tennis and cycling to stay healthy together.

I came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.
Because of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.  The chance to meet, talk, share a meal, converse with a group of people from different countries has to be good for our world.

In order to keep control of all details, my children and I personally are constantly here to help, explain and be of any assistance to you all, so to be informed of any and all needs you might have: we WILL TRULY do our maximum to accommodate you so always let US KNOW what you need, please!

I love to share my home with vacation rental guests. I have met so many kind and thoughtful people from all over the world. I grew up traveling frequently so now hosting brings the world to my door. YAY! It brings me great joy to have the opportunity to open my cherished home, and to share it with others. They can enjoy the space I have created and get to know San Francisco from the South of Market (SOMA) perspective. Right now SOMA really is the pulse of the city of San Francisco with all of the new restaurants, start ups, and wine bars. Not to mention SOMA is central to San Francisco highlights such as: Union Square, the Ball Park, the Cable Car ride, Westfield Mall and Market Street. It's even better to be one block from the Moscone Center, considering many of my guests are attending conferences during their stay! It is a pleasure to be able to offer everything at your fingers tips just steps away from my home and your home away from home.
